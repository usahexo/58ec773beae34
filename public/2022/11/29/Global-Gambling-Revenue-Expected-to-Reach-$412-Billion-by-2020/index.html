        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Global-Gambling-Revenue-Expected-to-Reach-412-Billion-by-2020"><a href="#Global-Gambling-Revenue-Expected-to-Reach-412-Billion-by-2020" class="headerlink" title="Global Gambling Revenue Expected to Reach $412 Billion by 2020"></a>Global Gambling Revenue Expected to Reach $412 Billion by 2020</h1><p>The global gambling market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3.8 percent to reach $412 billion by 2020, according to a new report by Allied Market Research.</p>
<p>“The online gambling industry is projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period,” said the report. “This can be attributed to the increasing adoption of smart devices, rise in internet penetration, and surge in the number of betting enthusiasts.”</p>
<p> North America was expected to lead the pack with a revenue of $137.5 billion in 2020, followed by Europe with $117.5 billion and Asia-Pacific with $61 billion. The report also highlights that the global market for online gambling is projected to grow at a CAGR of 11 percent during the forecast period and reach a value of $59.9 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>Revenue from traditional gambling activities such as casino and poker are slowly declining, while sports betting and eSports are on the rise, said eSports company Unikrn’s CEO Rahul Sood in an interview with GamesBeat last year. Revenue from betting on traditional sports is already larger than that of casino games, he added.</p>
<p>“Casino gaming is starting to slow down because it’s not growing anymore,” Sood said. “In contrast, we’re seeing big growth inbetting on eSports and other new verticals because there’s so much more opportunity there.”</p>
<p>This shift has been seen globally, with countries like Australia legalizing online sports betting and Japan approving casinos last year. China is also moving towards liberalizing its gaming industry, which could result in a massive market potential for foreign investors.</p>
<h1 id="Online-Gaming-Accounts-for-Majority-of-Gambling-Revenue"><a href="#Online-Gaming-Accounts-for-Majority-of-Gambling-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Online Gaming Accounts for Majority of Gambling Revenue"></a>Online Gaming Accounts for Majority of Gambling Revenue</h1><p>Online gaming continues to grow in popularity, with revenue from such games reaching $81 billion in 2018. This is largely due to the convenience and accessibility of online gaming, which allows players to gamble from anywhere at any time.</p>
<p>Most of this revenue comes from gambling-related activities within online games themselves, such as betting on game outcomes or purchasing in-game items with real money. While traditional casino games still account for a significant share of gambling revenue, this is being gradually overtaken by online gaming.</p>
<p>This trend is expected to continue, with the global online gambling market forecast to reach $159 billion by 2023. This growth is being driven by the increasing popularity of mobile gaming, as well as the legalization of gambling in new markets.</p>
<p>Online gaming has already surpassed traditional casinos in terms of revenue, and this gap is only expected to widen in the coming years. This presents a significant opportunity for online gaming providers, who can capitalize on the growing demand for their services.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Revenues-to-Surge-in-Asia-Pacific-Region"><a href="#Gambling-Revenues-to-Surge-in-Asia-Pacific-Region" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Revenues to Surge in Asia Pacific Region"></a>Gambling Revenues to Surge in Asia Pacific Region</h1><p>The gambling industry is booming in the Asia Pacific region, with revenues forecast to surge by nearly a third in the next four years, according to a new study.</p>
<p>Revenues from gambling are expected to reach $137.5 billion by 2021, up from $105.8 billion this year, according to the research by GlobalData.</p>
<p>The largest market will be China, followed by Japan and South Korea. In China, gambling revenues are expected to grow from $64.5 billion this year to $89.7 billion by 2021, while in Japan they are forecast to increase from $22.3 billion to $30.3 billion over the same period.</p>
<p>“The growth of the gambling industry in the Asia Pacific region is being driven by rising income levels and increasing numbers of leisure travelers,” said Tirthankar Patnaik, a senior analyst at GlobalData.</p>
<p>“However, while opportunities exist for operators across most segments of the market, there remain significant variations in terms of regulation and social attitudes towards gambling across different countries in the region.”</p>
<p>Despite liberalization in several markets over recent years – including Singapore and The Philippines – Macau still dominates overall gaming revenue due to its large number of casinos and high-roller segment.</p>
<h1 id="North-America-Remains-Largest-Gambling-Market-Worldwide"><a href="#North-America-Remains-Largest-Gambling-Market-Worldwide" class="headerlink" title="North America Remains Largest Gambling Market Worldwide"></a>North America Remains Largest Gambling Market Worldwide</h1><p>The North American gambling market accounted for $41.86 billion in revenue in 2017, representing a 43.8% share of the global gambling market, according to a new report by GlobalData.</p>
<p>The Asia-Pacific region is the second-largest gambling market, with total revenue of $35.12 billion in 2017, a share of 35.8%. Europe is the third-largest gambling market with revenue of $25.65 billion, a share of 26.4%.</p>
<p>The global gambling market generated revenue of $119.73 billion in 2017 and is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.5% to reach $143.92 billion by 2022, according to GlobalData.</p>
<p>“The growth of the global gambling market is being driven by the increasing availability of gambling opportunities, including an increase in the number of regulated gaming venues and states offering legal sports betting,” said Aditya Kshirsagar, analyst at GlobalData. “In addition, rising consumer disposable income is also contributing to the growth of the global gambling market.”</p>
<p>North America Remains Largest Gambling Market Worldwide</p>
<h1 id="Macau-Overtakes-Las-Vegas-as-World’s-Largest-Casino-Destination"><a href="#Macau-Overtakes-Las-Vegas-as-World’s-Largest-Casino-Destination" class="headerlink" title="Macau Overtakes Las Vegas as World’s Largest Casino Destination"></a>Macau Overtakes Las Vegas as World’s Largest Casino Destination</h1><p>Macau has emerged as the world’s largest casino destination, overtaking Las Vegas for the first time in terms of revenue generated from gambling.</p>
<p>According to figures released by the Macau government, gaming revenues in the Chinese territory reached a record $44 billion in 2013, up 19 percent from the previous year.</p>
<p>Revenues from gambling in Las Vegas, meanwhile, amounted to $38.7 billion last year, down 2.7 percent from 2012.</p>
<p>The surge in Macau’s casino earnings is being driven by wealthy Chinese gamblers who are betting record sums of money on games such as baccarat.</p>
<p>During peak periods, so-called “VIP” players can be seen wagering millions of dollars on a single hand of cards.</p>
<p>The VIP segment now accounts for more than two thirds of Macau’s total gaming revenue.</p>
<p>Casino operators in Macau are now looking to expand into new markets outside China in order to sustain growth.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Sands, for example, is planning to open a $1.5 billion casino resort in Japan later this year, while MGM Resorts is looking at opportunities in Vietnam.</p>
