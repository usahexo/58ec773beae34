The Texans have made the playoffs in four of the past five seasons, and they are a strong favorite to make it five out of six this year.</p>
<p>Houston has a talented roster full of stars on both sides of the ball. On offense, quarterback Deshaun Watson is one of the most exciting players in the league, and he has a deep array of weapons at his disposal, including DeAndre Hopkins and Will Fuller. The Texans also have a dominant defensive line led by J.J. Watt, which makes them a formidable opponent for any team in the league.</p>
<p>Houston is primed for another great season in 2018, and there is no reason to think they won’t be contending for the Super Bowl again this year. Don’t bet against the Texans - they are poised to make another run at the title this season!</p>

How do you know which teams to bet on? What are the best strategies for winning money? And how can you avoid common mistakes?</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll provide expert advice on how to place bets on the NFL. We’ll discuss different betting strategies, helpful tips for choosing winning teams, and how to stay safe while gambling online.</p>
<p>So, let’s get started!</p>
<p>How to Place Bets on the NFL</p>
<p>One of the first things you need to know about betting on the NFL is that there are many different types of bets you can make. Here are some of the most common types:</p>
<p>Point Spread Betting: This is probably the most popular type of bet when it comes to NFL games. With point spread betting, you are betting that one team will beat the other team by a certain number of points. For example, if the Patriots are playing the Buffalo Bills and the point spread is 13 points, then you would bet that New England would beat Buffalo by at least 13 points. If they only win by 11 points, then you would lose your bet.</p>
<p>Moneyline Betting: With moneyline betting, you are simply betting on which team will win the game. There is no point spread involved in this type of bet.</p>
<p>Over/Under Betting: This type of bet involves predicting whether or not the total score of a game will be over or under a certain number. For example, if the over/under is set at 46 points and the Patriots score 27 points in their game against Buffalo, then anyone who placed an over bet would win their wager. Similarly, if the 49ers scored 38 points against Tampa Bay but the total was set at 47 points, anyone who placed a under bet would have won their wager.</p>
<p>Parlay Betting: Parlay betting is when you combine two or more bets together into one larger wager. For example, if you wanted to place a parlay bet on three games, you would put down your chosen stake for all three games and then whichever team won all three games would payout at much higher odds than if each individual game was wagered on separately. However, if just one of your teams loses then your entire parlay bet will lose as well.</p>
