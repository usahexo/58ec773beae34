      		<h1 id="MO-Looks-to-Join-NJ-NV-in-Allowing-Legal-Sports-Betting"><a href="#MO-Looks-to-Join-NJ-NV-in-Allowing-Legal-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="MO Looks to Join NJ, NV in Allowing Legal Sports Betting"></a>MO Looks to Join NJ, NV in Allowing Legal Sports Betting</h1><p>In the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to strike down a federal law prohibiting most sports betting, lawmakers in Missouri are considering whether to allow regulated gambling on professional and college sports within the state’s borders.</p>
<p>Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, a Republican and candidate for the U.S. Senate, announced his support for legalized sports betting on Tuesday and urged the legislature to act swiftly.</p>
<p>“It is time for Missouri to act,” Hawley said in a statement. “Our state should legalize sports betting and allow Missourians to enjoy this activity in a safe and responsible manner. This is common-sense reform that will generate new revenue for our state while protecting consumers.”</p>
<p>Hawley, who is seen as a likely challenger to incumbent Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill this fall, joins his counterparts in New Jersey and Nevada in supporting regulated sports betting. In October, voters in New Jersey approved a ballot measure allowing casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting, while Nevada has offered legal sports betting since 1949.</p>
<p>If Missouri follows suit, it would become the fourth state to allow regulated sports betting, joining Delaware, Montana and Oregon as jurisdictions where single-game wagering is allowed but not online betting.</p>
<p>Supporters argue that legalizing sports betting would bring much-needed revenue to the state government, with estimates of up to $24 million in additional annual tax revenue. They also argue that it would be a safe and responsible way for adults to enjoy some friendly wagers on their favorite teams without breaking the law.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports betting note that it could lead to increased rates of addiction andambling problems as well as organized crime infiltration into the sportswagering market. They also argue that it would be difficult to properly regulate such a large industry without harming consumers.</p>
<h1 id="Bill-to-Allow-Sports-Betting-in-Missouri-Introduced"><a href="#Bill-to-Allow-Sports-Betting-in-Missouri-Introduced" class="headerlink" title="Bill to Allow Sports Betting in Missouri Introduced"></a>Bill to Allow Sports Betting in Missouri Introduced</h1><p>A bill has been introduced in the Missouri State Legislature that would legalize sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>The proposed bill, House Bill 1016, was filed on January 9th by Representative Kevin Corlew. The legislation would allow casinos and other gambling establishments to offer sports betting, subject to approval by the Missouri Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>“This legislation will allow Missourians to engage in what has become a popular pastime across the country,” said Corlew. “It will also create new revenue for the state, which can be used to fund priorities like education and infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Missouri is one of several states where efforts are underway to legalize sports betting in the wake of last year’s U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down a federal ban on the practice. In May of 2018, the Court ruled that the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) was unconstitutional, allowing states to decide whether to legalize sports betting within their borders.</p>
<p>Since then, several states have begun discussions on how best to implement sports betting, including New Jersey, which launched its first legal bets in late November. Other states that have introduced legislation include Mississippi, New York,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> Pennsylvania and West Virginia.</p>
<h1 id="Could-Missouri-be-the-Next-State-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Could-Missouri-be-the-Next-State-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Could Missouri be the Next State to Legalize Sports Betting?"></a>Could Missouri be the Next State to Legalize Sports Betting?</h1><p>On May 14, 2018, the United States Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, which effectively banned sports betting across the country. This decision has led many states to consider legalizing sports betting within their borders.</p>
<p>Missouri is one of these states, and lawmakers there are currently debating two bills that would allow sports betting within the state. The first bill, SB 767, would allow in-person and online sports betting at casinos and racetracks. The second bill, HB 2002, would allow only in-person sports betting and would not permit online betting.</p>
<p>Both bills have been passed by the Missouri Senate but are still pending in the House. If either bill becomes law, Missouri would become the eighth state to legalize sports betting since the SCOTUS decision.</p>
<p>Missouri is a desirable market for sports betting because it is a large state with a lot of potential for revenue growth. In 2017, legalized gambling generated more than $3 billion in revenue for Missouri casinos, racetracks, and the state lottery. This money helps fund education and other public services in Missouri.</p>
<p>Legalized sports betting could add another $200 million to this total each year. Some estimates even suggest that legalized sports betting could generate as much as $500 million in annual revenue for Missouri casinos and racetracks. This would make Missouri one of the top states in the country for gambling revenue.</p>
<p>There is some opposition to legalizing sports betting in Missouri, mostly from religious groups who oppose all forms of gambling. However, most lawmakers appear to be in favor of legalization, and it is likely that at least one of the two bills will be passed into law this year.</p>
<p>If you live in Missouri, keep an eye on this issue as it progresses. Legalized sports betting could be coming to a casino or racetrack near you very soon!</p>
<h1 id="Pro-Sports-Betting-Bill-Filed-in-Missouri-Legislature"><a href="#Pro-Sports-Betting-Bill-Filed-in-Missouri-Legislature" class="headerlink" title="Pro-Sports Betting Bill Filed in Missouri Legislature"></a>Pro-Sports Betting Bill Filed in Missouri Legislature</h1><p>On Wednesday, Feb. 20, pro-sports betting bill was filed in Missouri Legislature. The proposed bill, House Bill 2019, seeks to amend current law to allow sports betting at casinos and horse racing tracks in the state.</p>
<p>The lead sponsor of the bill is Rep. Bart Korman (R), who said that the legislation would bring in much-needed revenue for the state. He also believes that the amendment would create jobs and increase tourism.</p>
<p>“This is about creating jobs and bringing more money to Missouri,” Korman said. “It’s a good thing for our state.”</p>
<p>Rep. Korman is not alone in supporting the amendment; many other lawmakers are also on board with the idea of sports betting in Missouri. In fact, a Quinnipiac University poll conducted in November 2018 found that 68 percent of voters in Missouri support legalizing sports betting.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of momentum behind it,” said Rep. Sonya Anderson (R). “I think it will be a popular bill.”</p>
<p>If passed, HB 2019 would allow single-game and season-long wagers on professional and collegiate sporting events. Strict regulations would be put in place to protect consumers, including requirements that bets only be placed through licensed operators and that players must be at least 21 years old.</p>
<p>The proposed bill comes as several other states are also moving forward with legalization of sports betting. In January, Delaware became the first state to offer full-scale sports betting since the repeal of PASPA (the federal law prohibiting most sports betting). Since then, more than a dozen other states have introduced legislation to legalize some form of sports gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Missouri-Lawmakers-File-Bill-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Missouri-Lawmakers-File-Bill-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Missouri Lawmakers File Bill to Legalize Sports Betting"></a>Missouri Lawmakers File Bill to Legalize Sports Betting</h1><p>A group of Missouri lawmakers has filed a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. The bill, HB 2226, was introduced on Wednesday by Representatives Nick Smith and Cody Smith.</p>
<p>Under the proposed legislation, sports betting would be regulated by the Missouri Gaming Commission. The commission would be responsible for issuing licenses and setting regulations for the industry.</p>
<p>Players would be able to place bets on sporting events at casinos and other approved locations. Bets could also be placed online or through mobile apps.</p>
<p>The bill would levy a tax of 10% on gross gaming revenue from sports betting. This money would be used to fund programs for problem gamblers and for the regulation of the industry.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say that it will create more jobs and generate more money for the state. They argue that sports betting is already taking place in Missouri, so it should be legalized and taxed.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill say that it will lead to more gambling addiction problems. They also argue that it will be difficult to regulate given the popularity of online betting.</p>
<p>If passed, Missouri would join a growing number of states that have legalized sports betting. It is estimated that nearly $150 billion is wagered on sports each year in the United States, but only a small fraction of this is legal.</p>
