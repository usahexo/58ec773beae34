#  Secret tips to winning at Mazu casino game – guaranteed!

The casino game of Mazu is simple to play but difficult to win. There are some tricks to the game that can help players up their chances of winning and we’re going to share them with you!

First, let’s take a look at the basic rules of the game. The aim of Mazu is to gather as many points as possible by collecting tiles with numbers on them. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

There are a few things to keep in mind when playing Mazu:

1. The number on a tile dictates how many points that tile is worth.

2. Tiles can only be collected if they are adjacent to ones you already have – you can’t collect tiles that are diagonal from your existing ones.

3. Wild tiles are worth 10 points each and can be used as any number desired when scoring.

4. When you have collected all of the tiles for a number, that number is added to your score and any remaining wild tiles are also added. So, if you have two 5s and a wild, your score would be 25 (5 + 5 + 10). If you have two 6s and a wild, your score would be 36 (6 + 6 + 10).

  With those basics in mind, let’s move onto the tips! 

  Tip 1: Pay attention to the board While it may sound like common sense, one of the biggest mistakes players make when playing Mazu is not paying attention to the board! Remember, you can only collect tiles if they are adjacent to ones you already have so keeping an eye on what’s available is key. 

  Tip 2: Use wild tiles wisely Another important thing to remember about wild tiles is that they can be used as any number desired when scoring. This means that if you’re close to reaching a target score, using a wild tile instead of picking up another numbered tile could mean the difference between winning and losing. 

  Tip 3: Take advantage of bonuses Finally, there a few bonuses available during gameplay which can give players an edge. For example, there’s a bonus available for collecting all of the tiles for a particular number – this will add that number amount to your score! There are also bonuses available for collecting sets of different numbers – so try and keep an eye out for opportunities like this while playing.
