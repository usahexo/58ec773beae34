#  Who Created the First Casino Microgaming Gamevy?

The first casino game by Microgaming was Gamevy. This was a simple dice game that did not have any of the features that are common in modern casino games. For example, there were no bonus rounds, no free spins, and no multipliers.

Interestingly, the concept for this game was originally devised by an online bingo company. Microgaming licensed the game from this company and adapted it for use in a casino setting. The result was a game that was simple to play but could still provide some excitement.

There is no doubt that Gamevy helped to pave the way for future Microgaming casino games. It showed that this software provider was capable of developing games that were both fun and exciting to play. This undoubtedly helped to increase confidence in their products and encouraged players to try out other games created by Microgaming.
