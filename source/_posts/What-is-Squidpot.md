#  What is Squidpot?

Squidpot is a powerful open-source tool for ingesting, transforming and routing log data. It was created to help organizations deal with the ever-increasing volumes of data being generated by their systems and applications.

Squidpot consists of three core components: a collector, a transformer and a dispatcher. The collector gathers data from a variety of sources, such as syslogs and application logs, and forwards it to the transformer. The transformer cleans and prepares the data for analysis, before routing it to the appropriate destination. The dispatcher determines where the data should be sent, based on rules defined by the user.

One of the key benefits of Squidpot is its flexibility. It can be used to process log data in real-time or as part of a larger big data processing pipeline. And because it’s open source, users can adapt it to their specific needs.

# How Does Squidpot Work?

The collector component of Squidpot is responsible for gathering log data from various sources and forwarding it to the transformer. The collector can be run on any platform, including Windows, Linux and MacOS, and can collect data from local files or remote systems over TCP or UDP sockets.

The transformer component is responsible for cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. It can remove unwanted fields from the input data, format the data into a specific schema, and convert text files into JSON or CSV formats. The transformer also includes features for parsing structured log messages into a normalized form that can be easily analyzed by downstream applications.

The dispatcher component determines where the data should be sent, based on one or more predefined rules. It can route data to different destinations depending on the type of message or field value, allowing users to easily send specific types of log messages to different systems or applications for further processing or analysis.

#  What is the Squidpot Game? 

The Squidpot game is a strategy game designed to test players’ tactical prowess. The aim of the game is to manoeuvre your squids into the opponent’s pot, while preventing them from doing the same to you.

The game board consists of a playing area and two pots, one at either end of the playing area. Players take turns to move their squids one square at a time. Squids can only move sideways or forwards, and cannot move backwards. The goal is to get as many of your squids as possible into the opponent’s pot, while stopping them from getting into yours.

If a player moves their squid onto an opponents square, then their opponent can capture that squid by moving it into their own pot. If a player moves their squid into their own pot, then they have protected that squid and it cannot be captured by the opponent. The game continues until all of the squids have been captured, or one player has successfully moved all of their squids into the opponent’s pot.

A fun, addicting and easy to play game for everyone!

Squidpot is a game where you use your fingers to control four tentacles and catch as many squids as possible. The game is over when you catch 10 squids or when the clock runs out. You get 1 point for every squid caught and 3 points for every squid caught in the last 30 seconds.

How to Play:

1. Use your four fingers to control the tentacles.

2. The left and right tentacles move together, so move your hand left or right to control them.

3. The up and down tentacles move independently, so move your hand up or down to control them.

4. Catch squids by extending the tentacles into their space.
