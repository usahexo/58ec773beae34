#  How much do they cost? 
The amount of money you need to spend in order to get a tattoo will vary depending on the artist, the size of the tattoo, and the location of the tattoo. Generally, though, you can expect to spend between $50 and $200 for a small tattoo, between $200 and $600 for a medium-sized tattoo, and between $600 and $1,000 for a large tattoo. 

Of course, these are just ballpark figures. If you want a particularly intricate or large design, your costs could be much higher. Additionally, if you're looking for a custom piece or want to work with an experienced artist, you'll likely end up paying more than someone who goes with a more generic option. 

That said, tattoos don't have to be expensive. If you're looking for something simple and small, you can probably find an artist who will do it for less than $50. Just be sure to do your research ahead of time so that you know what to expect in terms of cost and quality.

#  Are they legal tender? 
Coin collectors everywhere debate the legal tender status of different coins. The government issues some coins that are specifically intended to be used as currency, while others have a collector’s value only. So, which coins are legal tender, and which ones aren’t?

The short answer is that just about any coin can be considered legal tender under certain circumstances. Whether or not a particular coin is actually used as currency depends on the laws of the specific country or territory where it is circulated. Generally, the coins that are specifically designated as legal tender by a government are the ones that will be accepted for payment of debt obligations. However, there may be other reasons why a particular coin is considered legal tender in a certain place. 

For example, in the United States, all coins are legal tender, but they may not necessarily be accepted for all types of payments. The most common usage is probably for small amounts of money owed between individuals. For larger transactions, businesses and other institutions may not want to accept coins because of the hassle of counting and sorting them. In some cases, businesses may even face penalties for refusing to accept legal tender. 

The penny, nickel, dime and quarter are all considered legal tender in the United States. The dollar bill is also a form of legal tender, but it is not technically a coin. Other countries have their own specific coins that are designated as legal tender. For example, in Canada the penny, nickel and dime are also considered legal tender, but the loonie and toonie are not. 

As you can see, there is no one definitive answer to this question. It depends on where you are and what type of payment you need to make. If you’re ever unsure whether or not a particular coin is considered legal tender, do some research or ask an expert!
